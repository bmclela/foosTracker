# FoosTracker

I developed this full stack web application to track the rankings of my friends and I as we played foosball games. Because the original application is still used regularly, this is a separate instance to showcase my work. The project was built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and deployed on Heroku. Other technologies used include Redux, React Router, React Boostrap, Mongoose, Cron, and Axios.
